Forked from: 
https://github.com/Winzen/Deck-Builder-Master-Duel-Macro

I'm releasing this version because maybe it can be useful to someone
## Download to Executable

**https://github.com/dhd0004/Deck-Builder-Master-Duel-Macro/releases/tag/0.2**

## **This version is not perfection**

- Executable size is too big 
- Sometimes because of how the searchs works in mastel duel some cards may be wrong in your deck after the macro ends
- You need to cricl in search bar and first card
- It's just the first version
- I can do it better and i accept help
